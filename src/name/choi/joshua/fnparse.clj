; A rule is a delay object that contains a function that:
; - Takes a collection of tokens.
; - If the token sequence is valid, it returns a (0) vector containing the (1)
;   consumed symbols' products and (2) a state data object, usually a map. The
;   state contains the (3) sequence of remaining tokens, usually with the key
;   *remainder-accessor*.
; - If the given token sequence is invalid, then the rule Fails, meaning that it either
;   simply returns nil.

; - (0) is called the rule's Result.
; - (1) is called the rule's Product.
; - (2) is called the rule's State.
; - (3) is called the rule's Remainder.
